NetSuite Token-Based Authentication
You can configure NetSuite connections to use token-based authentication to access NetSuite.
Token-based authentication is the preferred method to access NetSuite. When a connection uses token-based authentication, the agent uses a token ID and token secret to access NetSuite instead of a user name and password. The NetSuite connection must use WSDL URL version 2015_2 and above to use token-based authentication.
To set up token-based authentication, you install a NetSuite bundle for Informatica Cloud token-based authentication and generate a token ID and token secret in NetSuite. The token does not expire unless you revoke it from your NetSuite account. However, you might need to update the bundle and generate a new token if Informatica updates the bundle version in the future.
You enter the generated token ID and token secret when you specify the NetSuite connection properties in Informatica Cloud. If you include token information and a user name and password for a connection that uses WSDL URL version 2015_2, the agent uses token-based authentication to access NetSuite.
Generating a NetSuite Token ID and Token Secret
To use token-based authentication, in NetSuite, you install an Informatica token-based authentication bundle and generate the token ID and token secret. You use the token ID and token secret when you configure the NetSuite connection in Informatica Cloud.
1.Log in to NetSuite using a Full Access or Administrator account.
2.Navigate to Customization > SuiteBundler > Search and Install Bundles.
3.Search for the keyword, "InformaticaTBABundle".
A bundle with Bundle ID of 116143 appears in the search results.
4.Select InformaticaTBABundle and install it.
5.Navigate to Setup > Users/Roles > Access Tokens > New.
6.For Application Name, select InformaticaTBAIntegration.
7.Write down the access token and token secret displayed on the page.
You enter the token ID and token secret in Informatica Cloud when you configure the NetSuite connection.
Note: If you lose the token information, you must generate another token in NetSuite. NetSuite does not provide token information for previously generated tokens.
